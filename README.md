# FormatMenu

Repeat (.) dots some number of times to align price in a menu.

Given an excel file of menu items, the script produces a word document with each item printed with dots between the dish name and price. The script is only a tool to make the repeating dots part of the menu making process less of a hassle. It is not to create a menu right off the bat. The output file is a precursor to the final product.

You can center align the script's output file (staging.docx in example) and have that as the final product. But this script was made because I needed to put sections in tables and this makes it easier to copy and paste the sections.

Script input(menu.xlsx):
<img src="/example1.png" alt="Excel doc" />  

---

Script output(staging.docx) and the example final menu(example menu.docx):
<img src="/example2.png" alt="Script output and the example final menu" />

## Settings

All customizable settings within the file.

- Width of each row.
- Toggling to displaying the dots (or just space)
- Font style, font size, boldness, italicize for the section, dish name (and price), and description
- Input file name
- Output file name
- Start/End Row
- Column of section, dish name, price, and description
- Character to repeat other than the dot

## Note

As you can see in the example pictures, for the last menu item, you have the newline character to insert newline intentionally.
